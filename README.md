# FizzBuzz Explorers

This is a project for learning about:
1. Start a node project.
2. Refactor a previous code example using JS modules.
3. Apply Test Driven Development methodology.
4. Use git to version every significant change in the project.
5. Use some dependencies.
6. Apply GitHub actions to automate test.
7. Fix code errors using ESLint.
8. Built an API using Express.

## Dependencies

Jest for testing, to install jest use:
```npm
npm install jest --save-dev
```

Eslint for fix error, to install ESLint use:
```npm
npm install eslint --save-dev
```

Express for server and API builting, to install Express use:
```npm
npm install express --save
```

## Main branch
In this branch is where my solution live, for check out you need to clone this repo into your computer and run:
```npm
npm install
```
Then for see how the different components works run:
```npm
npm run start
```
If you want to run the server use:
```npm
npm run server
```
if you want to run telegram bot server use:
1. In telegram send `/start` to @BotFather and follow the config for preparing a newBot `/newbot`.
2. When you finish @BotFather gives you and HTTP API token, you are going to save this token creating a `.env` file.
    ``` example
    TOKEN: 0423-02385:1542352
    ```
3. Finally run:
    ```npm
    npm run bot
    ```
